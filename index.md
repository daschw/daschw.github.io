Hi, I am Daniel and I am a mathematics, [Julia](https://julialang.org) and plotting enthusiast.
I studied mathematics at the University of Vienna and currently I am a PhD candidtate at the [Energy Economics Group](https://eeg.tuwien.ac.at/) of TU Wien, where I analyze and simulate the market integration of different flexibility options for energy systems with an increasing share of volatile renewable energy sources.
I love working with Julia professionally and since 2017 I have been co-maintaining [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) and the [JuliaPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots) organization.
